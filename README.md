# PyC4D_Helpers
A list of useful python functions and resources for Cinema4D. 
This repository aims to be a concentrated collection of useful scripts for common everyday C4D problems.
Hopefully at some point we won't have to dig into old posts in forums anymore.

Topics covered so far:
  - UserData Handling (adding, removing, searching, setting)
  - Material and Shader Creation
  - Hierarchy Navigation (Selecting, Deselecting, Selecting Children etc)
  - __OBJ Sequence Importing__
